# Java program for calculating the average of user-input numbers using varargs and arrays is well-structured and effective! Here's a breakdown and review:

- Stores those numbers in a double[] array.
- Passes the array to a method using varargs (double... numbers).
- Computes and displays the average of those numbers.
